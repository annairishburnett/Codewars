//CODEWARS CODING CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

// Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

// Example
// createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"
// The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.

// Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!



//MY SOLUTION:
//Parameters, Return, Examples, Edge Cases, Pseudo Code:

//P: Create a function that takes in an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9). No letters, special characters, or funny business? No
//R: Returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number. The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge. Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!
//E: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0] => returns "(123) 456-7890"
//E: None given.
//P: Psuedo code -> see comments in solution

// 1 - create a function that takes in an array
// 2 - simple and not very elegant, but you could use a template string and the array indices 
// 3 - return the value and call the function
