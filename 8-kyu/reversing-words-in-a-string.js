//CODEWARS CODING CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

// You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. Words are always separated by a single space.

// As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

// Example (Input --> Output)

// "Hello World" --> "World Hello"
// "Hi There." --> "There. Hi"

// Happy coding!






//MY SOLUTION:
//Parameters, Return, Examples, Edge Cases, Pseudo Code:

//P: input will be a string of at least two words that may have 
//R: return the string with the words reversed, words remained capitalized and if the word had a period after it the period moves with it
//E: "Hello World" --> "World Hello"
// "Hi There." --> "There. Hi"
//E: might have punctuation at the end of each string, might have straining spaces
//P: Psuedo code -> see comments in solution
