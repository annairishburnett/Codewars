//CODEWARS CODING CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

// An AI has infected a text with a character!!

// This text is now fully mutated to this character.

// Starting with the original text, and given a character, return the text once it has been mutated so that all of the characters in the original text have been replaced with the character.

// If the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.
// There will never be a case when both are empty as nothing is going on!!

// Note: The character is a string of length 1 or an empty string.

// Example:
// text before = "abc"
// character   = "z"
// text after  = "zzz"

//MY SOLUTION:
//Parameters, Return, Examples, Edge Cases, Pseudo Code:

//P: Input will be a string of text and a character, which will be a string of one character or an empty string. 
//R: Return the text string entirely converted to the input character, or an empty string if the text or the character are empty.
//E: text before = "abc"
    // character   = "z"
    // text after  = "zzz"
//E: If the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.
//P: see steps below
