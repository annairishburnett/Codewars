//CODEWARS CODING CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

// This code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why.

function multiply(a, b){
    a * b
}
  



//MY SOLUTION:
//Parameters, Return, Examples, Pseudo Code:

//P: The code does not execute properly.
//R: Not given - we can assume it's a number that's the product of a and b
//E: 2 * 2 = 4
//P: Psuedo code -> see comments in solution



function multiply(a, b){
    return a * b //The function was missing the return
}
  



//OTHER TOP SOLUTIONS FROM CODEWARS USERS:


multiply = function (a, b) {
    return a * b;
}


multiply = (a, b) => a * b;



//EXPLANATION FOR CODE ABOVE:

//Created a variable whose value is the function and added the return

//Created an array function with an implicit return
