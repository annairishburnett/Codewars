//CODEWARS CODING CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

// Your goal is to return multiplication table for number that is always an integer from 1 to 10.

// For example, a multiplication table (string) for number == 5 looks like below:


// 1 * 5 = 5
// 2 * 5 = 10
// 3 * 5 = 15
// 4 * 5 = 20
// 5 * 5 = 25
// 6 * 5 = 30
// 7 * 5 = 35
// 8 * 5 = 40
// 9 * 5 = 45
// 10 * 5 = 50


// P. S. You can use \n in string to jump to the next line.

// Note: newlines should be added between rows, but there should be no trailing newline at the end. If you're unsure about the format, look at the sample tests.
